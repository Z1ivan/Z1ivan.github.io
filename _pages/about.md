<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working as a research assistant at the Computational Social Science Research Center at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Prior to this, I obtained a Master's degree in Sociology at Central South University, where I conducted research in computational sociology. Additionally, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Labor and Social Security from Shanxi University, where I received multiple academic honors.

My main research interests lie in generative agents, computational social science, intelligent social governance and social simulation systems, with a particular focus on Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM). I also have a solid background in computational social science and data analysis, and I am passionate about applying these methods to interdisciplinary research in the humanities and social sciences. Currently, my research focuses on **AI Agents**, and I am actively exploring the paradigm shift from traditional ABM to GABM in social simulation driven by LLMs.
