<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working as a research assistant at the Computational Social Science Research Center at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Prior to this, I obtained a Master's degree in Sociology at Central South University, where I conducted research in computational sociology. Additionally, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Labor and Social Security from Shanxi University, where I received multiple academic honors.

My main research interests lie in generative agents, computational social science, intelligent social governance and social simulation systems, with a particular focus on Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM). I also have a solid background in computational social science and data analysis, and I am passionate about applying these methods to interdisciplinary research in the humanities and social sciences. Currently, my research focuses on **Personalized LLMs and AI Agents**, and I am actively exploring the paradigm shift from traditional ABM to GABM in social simulation driven by LLMs.

[Rethinking the Reliability of Multi-agent System: A Perspective from Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10400)

**Lifan Zheng (*First Author*)**, et al.

*The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, 2026

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10400) [[PDF]](files/2511.10400v1.pdf)

- Enhancing multi-agent system reliability through Byzantine fault tolerance analysis of LLM-based agents and confidence-guided consensus mechanisms.
- Key findings: 
  -- LLM-based agents surpass traditional agents in fault tolerance, handling up to 85.7% malicious nodes (vs. 33% classical limit).
  -- CP-WBFT framework achieves 100% consensus accuracy under extreme Byzantine conditions through confidence-weighted information flow.
  -- Hidden-level confidence probes outperform prompt-level approaches, with topology design significantly impacting system reliability.
