<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently applying for PhD programs. I previously served as a **Research Assistant** at Zhejiang University, collaborating with [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Prior to this, I obtained my Master's degree in Sociology at Central South University, where I conducted research in *computational sociology*.

My main research interests lie in LLMs, Representation Learning, and Social Simulation. I have a solid background in social computing and data analysis, and I am passionate about applying these methods to interdisciplinary researches.

[Rethinking the Reliability of Multi-agent System: A Perspective from Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10400)

**Lifan Zheng (*First Author*)**, et al.

*The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, 2026

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10400) [[PDF]](files/2511.10400v2.pdf)

- Enhancing multi-agent system reliability through Byzantine fault tolerance analysis of LLM-based agents and confidence-guided consensus mechanisms.
- Key findings: 
  -- LLM-based agents surpass traditional agents in fault tolerance, handling up to 85.7% malicious nodes (vs. 33% classical limit).
  -- CP-WBFT framework achieves 100% consensus accuracy under extreme Byzantine conditions through confidence-weighted information flow.
  -- Hidden-level confidence probes outperform prompt-level approaches, with topology design significantly impacting system reliability.
